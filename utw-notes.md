**How to succeed in 4 simple steps.***

1. Define success.
2. Be brutally hones with yourself about yourself.
3. Keep it real - don't drink the company Kool-Aid.
4. Follow your instincts - be selective in taking advice.

* YMMV sometimes these don't actually work

Don't bootstrap. You trade time for money. Grow companies fast by taking VC money.

CEO-Founder of Weave (VoIP phone company)

* Y Combinator
* $9M in funding
* 20% M/M growth

~6 years to get to this point.

1. A startup will consume your life.
2. Your first idea probably won't be right.
3. Focus on today.
4. Learn to take a punch. Don't get knocked out.
5. There are no shortcuts. Build something people want.

"Half of what developers know will be obsolete in 2 years" -some source

Take control of your destiny by seizing the opportunity to learn.

Virtual Apprenticeships. Curated learning experiences from experts are great ways to learn.

"When I'm sleeping, I'm falling behind." 

Ways to improve learning:

1. Flip the classroom. Take control of your own education.
2. Embrace learning autonomy.
3. Personalize training paths.

"The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organizations ability to learn faster than anyone else."

Skills are the new currency. A skills-based transcript is what companies are looking for.

1. Ask a broad, open-ended question
2. Solve a problem

4. Validate market interest.
5. Re-test, reanalyze, launch MVP

Radical Transparency: The Path to Hypergrowth

The number one problem with business today is not the competition. It's what's going on within our own buildings.

The number one thing that will take us down is execution and the lack of it.

The old playbook is not working. There's a cultural problem in companies that cannot keep up.

Companies today need to hire people to **think**. Organizations that try to control how people think can't function.

The only thing we can control is the environment around people.

Why companies fail?

1. Focused Internally (friendly fire).
2. Confident over competent. Unable to identify who is which.
3. No unified external focus. Going in too many different directions.

Why radical transparency?

1. Everyone has the scoop. Everyone should have the ability to understand and think about problems in the company that can be solved. Let people see how things are happening as opposed to being told.
2. Creates a Meritocracy. Let the company follow the competent vs. the confident.
3. Everyone rows together.

One metric, and single focus. There is too much noise out there.

How do you keep the elephant dancing? Radical transparency. Everyone has to have everything. Everything has to be shared. The default setting is "Share".

Shared expense reports, sales figures(and sales person performance), what everyone is working on, etc.

What's wrong with Utah? Why do people sell too soon?

Try to do something really big. Be legendary.

1. Invite everyone you know to Utah.
2. Share everything.
3. If you want a share of the trillion dollars, we have to change.

Ask the question, "Why aren't we going to share this?".  Show vs. tell, you don't have to try so hard to sell an idea if you show someone exactly why certain things need to happen.

CSIO, Vivint (Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer- how's that for a title?)

Innovation is Hard.

Companies are not built to last, they are built to fail. There are only a handful of companies in the Fortune 100 of 1917 that are still in business, and even fewer are still on the Fortune 100. Companies have to constantly innovate, or die.

To be successful, innovation requires:

1. Visionary Leadership
2. Quick pivoting
3. Talent

Grab onto ideas that will cannibalize previous business. Examples: Apple's new products continuously cannibalize previous products. Amazon kindle cannibalizes physical book sales, but Jeff Bezos did it because he knew it was the future.

When you are starting a business, you are not a risk taker, but a risk mitigator.

Quick pivoting. Assess the product and iterate quickly.

Talent. What attracts them? Solving really difficult and cool problems. Vivint has been recruiting heavily all over.
